User Access Scenario:
A user wants to access www.foobar.com, a website hosted on a single server with the following components:

Server:
A physical or virtual machine with an IP address 8.8.8.8.
Web Server (Nginx):
Nginx serves as the front-facing server that handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content. It acts as a reverse proxy to the application server.
Application Server:
This server runs the application logic and generates dynamic content based on user requests. It communicates with the database server to fetch and store data.
Application Files (Your Code Base):
The code base contains the website's application logic, scripts, and files required to run the website.
Database (MySQL):
MySQL is used to store and manage the website's data. It interacts with the application server to handle data retrieval and storage operations.
Domain Name (foobar.com) with www Record:
The domain name foobar.com is configured with a www record pointing to the server's IP address 8.8.8.8.
Specifics Explanation:
Server: A server is a computer or software system that provides functionality or services to other programs or devices, known as clients.

Domain Name: A domain name is a human-readable address used to access websites. It provides a way to map easily remembered names to numerical IP addresses like 8.8.8.8.

DNS Record www: The www record in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record that points to the domain's root record, indicating that the website is hosted on the server associated with the domain.

Web Server: Nginx acts as the web server, handling incoming HTTP requests, serving static content, and routing requests to the application server for dynamic content generation.

Application Server: The application server executes the website's business logic, processes user requests, and generates dynamic content. It communicates with the database to retrieve and store data.

Database: MySQL is used to store and manage the website's data, providing a structured mechanism for data storage and retrieval.

Communication with User's Computer: The server uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with the user's computer, delivering web pages and content over the internet.

Issues with the Infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
The entire website is hosted on a single server, making it vulnerable to failure. If the server goes down, the website becomes inaccessible.
Downtime during Maintenance:
When performing maintenance tasks like deploying new code that requires restarting the web server, the website will experience downtime, impacting user accessibility.
Scalability Challenges:
With only one server, the infrastructure cannot easily handle a surge in incoming traffic. Scaling to accommodate increased load requires additional servers and load balancing mechanisms.
By addressing these issues through redundancy, load balancing, and scalability measures, the web infrastructure can become more resilient and capable of handling varying levels of traffic and maintenance requirements.
